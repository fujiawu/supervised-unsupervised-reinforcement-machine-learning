Project 1: Supervised Learning

Instructions for running my code:

I used Matlab 2014b for this project assignment.
To run the code, simply run all the m-file that I turned in.

I used two data sets for this assignments.
1) Car Evaluation Data Set 
2) Mushroom Data Set 

Both data sets come from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom
Their data files are located in the folders named "car" and "mushroom",
respectively.

From the file names of m-file, it can easily been inferred the
purpose of the code. For example, the file "decision_tree_car.m"
performs machine learning of the Car Evaluation Data using decision
tree.

In total, 5 machine learning algorithms have been used, i.e.,

1)Decision trees with some form of pruning
2)Neural networks
3)Boosting
4)Support Vector Machines
5)k-nearest neighbors

Thus, in total there are 10 m-files.
