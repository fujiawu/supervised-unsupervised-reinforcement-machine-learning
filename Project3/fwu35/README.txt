For this assignment, I used the scikit-learn Machine Learning tool.
To run the code, simply run all the .py file that I turned in:

                     KMeans:  kmeans_car.py  kmeans_mushroom.py
                         EM:  em_car.py  em_mushroom.py
                        PCA:  pca_car.py  pca_mushroom.py
                        ICA:  ica_car.py  ica_mushroom.py
          Random Projection:  rp_car.py  rp_mushroom.py
Univariate feature selection: skb_mushroom.py

The file load_mydata.py is a helper file for loading my datasets.
The file plot_my_data.py is a post-processing script for plotting.

I used the two datasets I used in Project 1:
(1)car.data
(2)mushroom.data
They are also included in this folder.
