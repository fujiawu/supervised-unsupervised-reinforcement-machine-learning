I don't think so, but ABAGAIL does.  
 
src/func for Clustering algorithms
shared/fit for dimensional reduction algorithms.



Only partly answers your questions. WEKA has the EM and K-Means Clustering algorithms, but I couldn't find any of the dimensional reduction algorithms. They maybe be called something else, or I missed them.


You can perform Dimensional Reduction in Weka through 'Feature Selection' and 'Preprocessing' steps.
